# **The Smart Modules API**
The Smart Module API is a small framework for quickly binding multiple modules into a single package.  Each module has access to other modules that are loaded, as well as any variables within the API itself.

## Getting Started
You will need to have the sm.core.js module loader brought into your project.  Modules will also need to be included as individual sm.modulename.js files.
